CE1

Welcome to our project!
Our intent is to inspect the relationship between the political position of parties and their capability to gain votes. 
To do so we decided to analize it in four different countries: 2 European countries, that are Italy and Germany, and 2 non-European countries, that are Australia and Japan, using data from ParlGov.

Hopefully this project is useful to study wether centrist political parties are more succesful than others or not.

Our project is divided in 4 folders. 
The data we used for this analysis is contained in the folder ***data***, that is divided in "original_data", where we put the original dataset that we downloaded from ParlGov, and the "recoded _data", that is the dataset with the variables we selected for our scope.
The folder ***script*** contains 3 R scripts that we used to analyze our data and gather the information we needed to try to answer toour research question.
The folder ***docs*** contains the final report and the graphs we made.
And finally the ***junk*** folder contains all the files we used to run our analysis and that we no longer need.

The contributors of this project are: Fabiana Giannuzzi, Riccardo Ruta and Anna Ludovica Vinelli, three students from the University of Milan.
